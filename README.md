# Live Image Search Filter with React.js

This project is a simple web application built with React.js that allows users to search for images in real-time using a search filter. Users can type in a search term, and the application will fetch and display relevant images from the Unsplash API.

## Features

- Real-time image search: Users can search for images by typing in a search term.
- Dynamic image display: Images are displayed dynamically based on the user's search query.
- 
This project utilizes the `useState` hook from React to manage state within functional components. The `useState` hook allows components to manage local state without needing to use class components. In this project, the `useState` hook is used to manage the search term entered by the user and to store the fetched images from the Unsplash API.
